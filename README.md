# Dedalus Adjoint Examples

This is an examples repository for problems utilizing automatic discrete adjoints in Dedalus.
The repository includes the examples described in [1] as well as several others.
They can be ran using the `d3-adjoint-rebase` branch from [this repository](https://github.com/kburns/dedalus_adjoint).
