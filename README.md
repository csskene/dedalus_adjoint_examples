# Dedalus Adjoint Examples

This is an examples repository for problems utilizing automatic discrete adjoints in Dedalus.
The repository includes the examples described in [1] as well as several others.
They can be ran using the `adjoint` branch from [the main Dedalus repository](https://github.com/DedalusProject/dedalus).

The extra requirements needed to run the examples can be installed with
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
